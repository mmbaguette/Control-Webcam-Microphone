# Control Webcam & Microphone (Almost)

**Play a YouTube video, show an image on your computer, or stream a music file on any video or voice call platform!**

This program uses the [OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to simulate a virtual camera, and the
[VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) to simulate a virtual microphone.

Enter a YouTube video link, the name of an audio or video file, or say something using the Google Translate voice, 
"tld" to change the domain of the accent, "lang" to to change the language or voice, "ptt" to toggle push to talk.

### Issues:
- For efficiency, this program streams YouTube videos without downloading the entire video file before playing it.
For this reason, I have to do the same for audio, but I can't get that to work yet. However, audio should still 
play fine with **non-YouTube videos**.

**Make sure to select a different virtual microphone and web camera on your platform settings, like Zoom or Discord.**\
